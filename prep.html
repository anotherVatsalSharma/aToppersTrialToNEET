				How To Prepare For NEET ?
			</div>
			<div class="neetprepa">
				<p>There is no single correct answer to this question nor a universal method which a person needs to follow . Even I had a lot of trouble finding the method suitable for me.</p>
				<div><br /></div>
				<div>But from personal experience, I would suggest you to start with the NCERT. Yes that's right, the NCERT. I know you have heard this a lot but the NCERT <b>is</b> a NEET aspirants' BIBLE. </div>
				<div><br /></div>
				<div>I admit that NCERT is not enough to score well in NEET but I NEVER said to ONLY do the NCERT. </div>
				<div><br /></div>
				<div>The thing is that there is a lot to do and I know you would prefer a book that has everything, from the basics to the advanced concepts BUT retention of concepts is very low if you do everything together.</div>
				<div><br /></div>
				<div>I would suggest that you first do the NCERT to cover all the basics (because it is most important to build the fundamentals and strengthen the base) once that is done then you can move on to the higher concepts from any refresher or
					guide that you follow.</div>
				<div><br /></div>
				<div>DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT thing that the NCERT is low level and you can do without it. Even if you are well versed with even the higher concepts you MUST do the NCERT first.</div>

				How To Make A Schedule To Follow For Studying ?
			</div>
			<div class="neetprepa">
				<i>Without planning nothing can be accomplished.</i>.<div><br />Drawing a study plan helps you find a balance that you are comfortable with and also helps in developing good study habits and establish good study routines which ensures that
					all subjects are studied. It is important to have an effective timetable to help you manage the time spent on each subject.</div>
				<div>Having a study plan/schedule helps learners discover ways to study effectively.<h1 style="text-align: center;">A Typical Day's Schedule</h1>
					<div><br /></div>
					<div>I'm not telling you to make an hour to hour schedule (that never works) what I <b>AM </b>saying is that you use the following formula to calculate the number of hours that you can study and stick to that number!</div>
					<div><br /></div>
					<div>The formula-</div>
					<h4>Number of available hours = N = {24 - (S + E + T + F + R)} * 0.75</h4>
					<div>Explanation of the formula-</div>
					<div><br /></div>
					<div>Total no. of hours in a day = 24</div>
					<div>S = time required for sleep</div>
					<div>T = time spent in school and tuition</div>
					<div>E = eating time / the time you require for eating in a day</div>
					<div>F = free time in which you socialize, talk to family and friends</div>
					<div>R = recreational time which should be your alone time whether it be reading or exercising that's up to you</div>
					<div>
						<p>{24 - (S + E + T + F + R)} gives to the remaining time in which you can study <b>BUT </b>I think its impossible to be studying every single moment that you can.</p>
						<p>So, to make the formula practical you must believe that you can realize only 75% of this time.</p>
						<p><br /></p>
						<p>For me, these variables had the following values,</p>
						<div>
							<div>S = 6 hours</div>
							<div>E = 2 hours ( ~40 mins for each meal )</div>
							<div>T = 7 hours</div>
							<div>F = 2 hour</div>
							<div>R = 1 hour</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div><br /></div>
					<div>So according to the formula,</div>
					<div>N = {24 - (6 + 2 + 7 + 2 + 1)} * 0.75 = 4.5 hours that is 4 hours and 30 mins.</div>
					<div><br /></div>
					<div>Use the formula to get your own value of N. I would suggest that N should be at least 4 hours.</div>
					<div><br /></div>
					<div>Now take a stop watch and start it in the morning when you start studying, pause it every time you take a break to do any of the above activities and resume it when you start studying. At the end of the day make sure that the time
						displayed on the stopwatch is equal to N.</div>
					<div><br /></div>
					<div>It won't be easy but try to cope up with this schedule, remember <i><b>P</b></i><b><i>atience</i></b> <i>and</i> <i><b>Perseverance </b>are the only two arrows in your quiver.</i></div>

				How To START The Preperation ?
			</div>
			<div class="neetprepa">
				Now that you have understood how to prepare for NEET and how to make a schedule, it is time to start our learning.<div><br /></div>
				<div>As I've already mentioned, first give the NCERT a thorough reading. It is of utmost importance that you start with the NCERT. </div>
				<div><br /></div>
				<div>The first step is to read the NCERT once without break, without making any notes or marking anything, just plain reading. Try to understand the concepts.This is to familiarize yourself with the chapter. Even if you don't remember every
					thing, it's fine. You must get a gist of the chapter and understand what all it includes.</div>
				<div><br /></div>
				<div>The second step is to sit down with a pencil, give the chapter another reading and start marking all the important keywords and formulas that you come across. Not big sentences or definitions, only the keywords.</div>
				<div><br /></div>
				<div>The third step is to start making notes, the notes that you make should include everything- formulas, definitions, derivations and theory. It doesn't matter if you think that your notes are not notes but a copy of the NCERT. IT DOESN'T
					MATTER. If your subconscious says it's important then write it down. </div>
				<div><br /></div>
				<div>Once this is done then re-read your notes and make a formula chart. </div>
				<div><br /></div>
				<div>Do this for every chapter.</div>
				<div><br /></div>
				<div>I will be posting my notes for your reference but I suggest that you read them only after making your own notes.</div>
